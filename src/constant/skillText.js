     From the emergence of the World Wide Web in the 1990s to the burst of user-friendly 
     application frameworks in the 2010s,  and up to the present, AI has taken part in the job 
     by generating some coding templates. Application development has undergone significant evolutions 
     over the past three decades.  <span class="bold-text">I love its changing nature and I'm thrilled to learn using and applying 
     the newest technology</span>. On the one hand, Java and JavaScript are my backbones supporting me to acquire
      new skills. On the other hand, I'm concerned that instead of spending time exploring the endless new technology, 
      I'd rather spend that time learning in depth about not-so-new tools that I'm more familiar with and 
      apply regularly. Especially with AI taking on entry-level development tasks,  I'm concerned if my 
      learning pace can keep up with AI and if I'm replaceable. Despite these concerns on my journey as 
      a full-stack developer, I remind myself that all technologies, including AI, are ultimately 
      tools awaiting humans to unlock their full potential.  The skills I grasped about applying the 
      tools are most important.  While I may not be the most knowledgeable developer,  <span class="bold-text">my commitment 
      to continuous learning enables me to continually improve</span>. Through this journey, I trust 
      I'll uncover the answers to my concerns and find my unique place in the industry.<span class="initial">"</span>`,
