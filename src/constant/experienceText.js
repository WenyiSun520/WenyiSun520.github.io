    reflection: `Working at Lavner Education was an amazing journey. I exposed myself to several new technologies and learned from talented fellows.  I was able to manage my campers to complete their projects. I also demonstrated the ability to quickly grasp new concepts. More importantly, I realized that I didn't improve enough for inclusive and effective communication.
	Before the internship, I thought my communication skills were proficient. However, while instructing campers aged 6 to 12, I noticed my struggle to convey information efficiently. I often presented complex sentences that demanded extra time and effort for the young learners to understand.  I didn't give enough pause for the kids to process information. I gave fast-paced presentations that led to pronunciation errors.  The young learners required clear logic and sentences which I failed to fulfill. 
   In fact, not only young kids but also adults need clear logic and sentences. This should be a general standard. If I could improve my communication and deliver content to kids effectively, I could also effectively engage with adults.

      I adopted a structured approach, creating task lists every week and assigning each week's 
      tasks to individual days. I reported to my supervisor twice a week to highlight progress,
      potential delays, and problems. Through the project, I also examined my resilience and my 
      capability to embrace challenges. One of key feature of this project was a drag-and-drop board, 
      which was a uncharted territory for me. I initially experimented with the HTML drag-and-drop API 
      but I had a hard time implementing this API to my project. I immediately reported this issue 
      to my supervisor, outlining the problem, acknowledging the potential delay, and an anticipated 
      solution timeline. My later search led me to the "react-beautiful-dnd" library developed by Atlassian, 
      known for its Jira and Trello boards. After taking their tutorial videos, I had 
      confidence that it would suit our needs. I quickly created a demo and incorporated 
      this skill into my project.`,

              Covid-19. With the guidance of graduate and doctoral students, we
              deconstructed Tiktok layer by layer and sorted it into a large map
              to explore how the different media included in Tiktok act as a
              medium to spread information quickly. During the process, I
              learned that to analyze a product, finding the first perspective
              to investigate is crucial. Then from that one perspective, we can
              efficiently find another one and eventually construct a network.
