    reflection: `Working at Lavner Education was an amazing journey. I exposed myself to several new technologies and learned from talented fellows.  I was able to manage my campers to complete their projects. I also demonstrated the ability to quickly grasp new concepts. More importantly, I realized that I didn't improve enough for inclusive and effective communication.
	Before the internship, I thought my communication skills were proficient. However, while instructing campers aged 6 to 12, I noticed my struggle to convey information efficiently. I often presented complex sentences that demanded extra time and effort for the young learners to understand.  I didn't give enough pause for the kids to process information. I gave fast-paced presentations that led to pronunciation errors.  The young learners required clear logic and sentences which I failed to fulfill. 
   In fact, not only young kids but also adults need clear logic and sentences. This should be a general standard. If I could improve my communication and deliver content to kids effectively, I could also effectively engage with adults.

    reflection: ` At Shawk Solution,  I had an opportunity to independently design
     a product from the ground up. This project highlighted my project management skills.
      I adopted a structured approach, creating task lists every week and assigning each week's 
      tasks to individual days. I reported to my supervisor twice a week to highlight progress,
      potential delays, and problems. Through the project, I also examined my resilience and my 
      capability to embrace challenges. One of key feature of this project was a drag-and-drop board, 
      which was a uncharted territory for me. I initially experimented with the HTML drag-and-drop API 
      but I had a hard time implementing this API to my project. I immediately reported this issue 
      to my supervisor, outlining the problem, acknowledging the potential delay, and an anticipated 
      solution timeline. My later search led me to the "react-beautiful-dnd" library developed by Atlassian, 
      known for its Jira and Trello boards. After taking their tutorial videos, I had 
      confidence that it would suit our needs. I quickly created a demo and incorporated 
      this skill into my project.`,

    reflection: ` Being an instructor at SMART coding school made me realize that
              it's always useful to review the skills I have and test if I can
              understand them from a
              <span className="bold-text"> new perspective </span>. During the
              teaching, the concepts I thought were easy and quick to understand
              were absurd to my students, and it may take some of them several
              days to fully consume. This makes me realize that it's challenging
              to present a concept from one perspective to the extent that every
              audience can understand it at the same pace, and I have to go for
              another way.`,

    reflection: ` This experience inspired me on experiencing

              in project development. The research topic aimed to examine the
              motivation of TikTok users to spread debunking information about
              Covid-19. With the guidance of graduate and doctoral students, we
              deconstructed Tiktok layer by layer and sorted it into a large map
              to explore how the different media included in Tiktok act as a
              medium to spread information quickly. During the process, I
              learned that to analyze a product, finding the first perspective
              to investigate is crucial. Then from that one perspective, we can
              efficiently find another one and eventually construct a network.
              Of course, In this process of exploration, maintaining
              <span className="bold-text"> communication </span> with peers can
              be twice as effective.`,
